# Sahitya Sagar
**An Intelligent Literature Recommendation System Powered by Collaborative Filtering**

---

## 🔹 Description
*Sahitya Sagar* is an intelligent literature recommendation system developed as part of the **NIELIT A-Level Major Project**. It helps readers discover books, poems, and other literary works based on their interests using **collaborative filtering algorithms** (user-based and item-based).

The recommendation model is trained using **Python**, leveraging libraries like **NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing, similarity computation, and model optimization. The web application is built with **Flask** and styled using **HTML, CSS, and Tailwind**, providing a lightweight, responsive, and interactive interface for real-time recommendations.
